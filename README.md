RUN THE SIMULATION FILE FIRST TO GENERATE THE .NPY USED BY THE GRAPHS FILE (ANALYSIS)

RUN THE GRAPHS FILE TO GET 3 GRAPHS FOR POSITION, EK AND MOMENTUM BASED ON DIFFERENT VALUES OF DELTA (IN NBODYSYSTEM) AND RANGE(IN SIMULATION)

THE ANALYSIS FILES ARE PROVIDED IN THE ANALYSIS FOLDER 

SHORT TIME:
DELTA = 1000
RANGE=20000

LONG TIME:
DELTA=10000
RANGE=200000


Test1= earths gravity 
Test2= Massless particle
Test3= Earth returns to initial position with Delta = 1 year
